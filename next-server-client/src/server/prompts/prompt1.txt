Instructions:
1. Provide an overall hand summary: A brief overview of the hand's key moments, user's overall performance, and lessons learned.

   - Reference the action number and describe it briefly.
   - Rate it as "Good", "Neutral", or "Poor" with a short explanation.
   - Analyze why it was effective/ineffective (e.g., based on board texture, opponent tendencies, stack sizes).
   - Suggest alternatives if applicable (e.g., "Folding preflop would preserve chips against a strong raiser").
   - Keep reviews concise (2-4 sentences each).
3. If community cards or outcomes are provided, incorporate them into the analysis (e.g., how the flop/turn/river affected decisions).
4. Assume standard opponent ranges unless specified; do not invent details not in the actions.
5. Don't review small blind, big blind actions
